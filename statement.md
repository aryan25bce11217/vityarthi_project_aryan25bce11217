Problem statement:-
In an increasingly globalized world, people frequently travel, work, and conduct business across different countries. One common challenge they face is determining the equivalent value of money when
converting from one currency to another. Manual currency conversion is time-consuming, prone to errors, and inconvenient—especially when exchange rates vary across different sources.
To address this issue, there is a need for a simple, accurate, and user-friendly tool that can quickly convert an amount from one currency to another without requiring complex calculations.
The project aims to create a Python-based Currency Converter that allows users to input a currency type, select the target currency, enter an amount, and instantly receive the converted value.




Scope of the Project:-

1. Basic Currency Conversion
The project allows users to convert an amount from one predefined currency to another using fixed exchange rates.

2. User-Friendly Interaction
The system provides a simple, text-based interface where users can perform multiple conversions within a single run of the program.

3. Educational Purpose
The project demonstrates the use of Python programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, operators, and user input handling.

4. Standalone Application
It works as an offline tool without requiring internet connectivity, making the project easy to run on any device with Python installed.

5. Multiple Currency Support
The converter supports a selected set of popular global currencies to cover common use cases for learners and travelers




Target Users:-

1. International Travelers
Individuals who frequently travel abroad and need quick currency conversions for expenses, shopping, and budgeting.

2. Students and Beginners in Programming
Learners who want to understand basic Python concepts through a simple, real-world project.

3. Business Professionals
People involved in import–export, online purchasing, or international transactions who need approximate currency values.

4. General Users
Anyone who wants a quick and offline method to check the equivalent value of one currency in another.

5. Educators and Trainers
Teachers who can use this project as an example while teaching Python, algorithms, or problem-solving.




Features

1. Simple and User-Friendly Interface
The program provides clear prompts and easy navigation, making it accessible for all users.

2. Multiple Currency Conversion
Users can convert from one currency to another among a set of predefined global currencies.

3. Continuous Conversion Option
The program allows multiple conversions in a single run without restarting the script.

4. Fixed Exchange Rate Logic
Uses predefined conversion rates to ensure consistent and predictable output.

5. Error Handling
Prevents crashes by checking incorrect inputs and guiding the user back to valid options.

6. Beginner-Friendly Project
Designed to help learners understand Python basics and real-world application logic.
