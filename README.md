The name of this project is Currency converter. This project converts money of one currency to another.


 In this project, the concept that I used of python are like functions, operators, Conditional statement , Loops and many more concepts are used. I had use top down design and many more things. This Project comes in financial category. This project aims the real life problems like people wants to know how much 
"amount in any currency" can be in other currency .




Technologies used:-
1.I used Python Language as the primary language to develop the currency converter program. Python’s simplicity and powerful libraries made it ideal for me to implement logic, functions, loops, and user input handling.

2. I used Python IDLE which is a  code editor to write, run, and test the Python script efficiently.

3. I used Command Line / Terminal to execute the Python program and interact with user inputs.

   4. I used Word processors and PDF creation tools to prepare the project report, documentation, and formatting.




Steps to run the project:-
1. Open the Python File
Locate and open the currency converter .py file in editor or IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, etc.

2. Run the Program
Run the script by pressing Run or using the command:
python Currency-convertor-project.py

3. Choose the Source Currency
The program asks you to enter the currency you want to convert from (example:- USD, INR, EUR).

4. Choose the Target Currency
Next, enter the currency you want to convert to.

5. Enter the Amount
Type the amount of money you want to convert.

6. View the Converted Value
The program will calculate and display the converted amount based on predefined exchange rates.




Instructions for testing:-
1. Verify Program Execution
We can start by running the Python script to ensure the program runs without showing any syntax errors.

2. Test Currency Input
Enter different valid currency names or codes (example:- INR, USD, EUR) to confirm that the program accepts them correctly.

3. Test Invalid Currency Input
We can intentionally enter incorrect or unsupported currency names to check whether the program is able to handle errors gracefully and prompts the user correctly.
