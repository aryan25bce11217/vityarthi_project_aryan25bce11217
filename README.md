# vityarthi_project_aryan25bce11217
The name of project Currency converter. This project converts money of one currency to another.


 In this project, the concept of python like function, operators, Conditional statement , Loops and many more concepts are used. I had use top down 
design and many more things. This Project comes in financial category. This project aims the real life problems like people wants to know how much 
"amount in any currency" can be in other currency .




Technologies used:-
1.Python Programming Language
Used as the primary language to develop the currency converter program. Python’s simplicity and powerful libraries made it ideal for implementing logic, functions, loops, and user input handling.

2. Python IDLE
A code editor was used to write, run, and test the Python script efficiently.

3. Command Line / Terminal
Used to execute the Python program and interact with user inputs.

4. Flowchart and Algorithm Tools
Simple drawing tools or digital platforms were used to design the flowchart and algorithm before coding.

5. Documentation Tools
Word processors or PDF creation tools were used to prepare the project report, documentation, and formatting.




Steps to run the project:-
1. Open the Python File
Locate and open the currency converter .py file in your preferred editor or IDE (IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).

2. Run the Program
Execute the script by pressing Run or using the command:
python filename.py

3. Choose the Source Currency
The program will ask you to enter the currency you want to convert from (e.g., USD, INR, EUR).

4. Choose the Target Currency
Next, enter the currency you want to convert to.

5. Enter the Amount
Type the amount of money you want to convert.

6. View the Converted Value
The program calculates and displays the converted amount based on predefined exchange rates.




Instructions for testing:-
1. Verify Program Execution
Start by running the Python script to ensure the program loads without syntax errors.

2. Test Currency Input
Enter different valid currency names or codes (e.g., INR, USD, EUR) and confirm that the program accepts them correctly.

3. Test Invalid Currency Input
Intentionally enter incorrect or unsupported currency names to check whether the program handles errors gracefully and prompts the user correctly.
