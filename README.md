The name of this project is Currency converter. This project converts money of one currency to another.


 In this project, the concept that I used of python are like functions, operators, Conditional statement , Loops and many more concepts are used. I had use top down design and many more things. This Project comes in financial category. This project aims the real life problems like people wants to know how much 
"amount in any currency" can be in other currency .




Technologies used:-
1.I used Python Language as the primary language to develop the currency converter program. Python’s simplicity and powerful libraries made it ideal for me to implement logic, functions, loops, and user input handling.

2. I used Python IDLE which is a  code editor to write, run, and test the Python script efficiently.

3. I used Command Line / Terminal to execute the Python program and interact with user inputs.

   4. I used Word processors and PDF creation tools to prepare the project report, documentation, and formatting.


 Apply concepts learned in the course to design the solution: I had applied most of the concept I learnt during classes. I had used concept of python 
language like functions, conditional statements ,loops, Boolean value, break statement ,printing statement ,Operator ,Return statement and many 
more.. 
 Use appropriate tools, libraries, or programming techniques based on the subject: I had used appropriate tools, libraries or programming 
techniques based on the subject. In my project no libraries got installed. 

 Follow a structured development process: I had followed structured development process like aiming , planning, coding, testing, documenting. I 
had first decided what project is about, how this project will overcome real life problem, what is the aim of the project. Secondly, I had planned how 
this project is going to done ,made algorithm and flowchart before coding process. Then I had started with coding process that was easy part for 
me because algorithm and flowchart helped me a lot. Now after coding there is a testing part, This project passed testing by showing perfect output 
as expected. At last I had done documentation. 

  Problem definition: A problem is a task defined by its inputs, desired outputs, and constraints, which can be solved with an algorithm, It's often viewed 
as a function that maps inputs to outputs, and computer science is the study of algorithms that solve these problems, including those that may not 
have a solution. In this project ,it resolve the problem of converting currency by convert currency from one currency to another by doing 
two to three clicks. 

 Requirement analysis: The requirement for this project is zero. You only need any python compiler. That’s it. 

 Top-Down design: I had used top down design in my project. That is by defining what’s the problem after that by initialising loop variable for while loop 
then created the body of while loop. Then I had asked user to continue while loop or to exit the program by entering NO. 

Implementation: I had implemented things like  aiming , planning, coding, testing, documenting. I had first decided what project is about, how this project will overcome real life problem, what is the aim of the project. Secondly, I had planned how this project is going to done ,made algorithm and 
flowchart before coding process. Then I had started with coding process that was easy part for me because algorithm and flowchart helped me a 
lot. Now after coding there is a testing part, This project passed testing by showing perfect output as expected. At last I had done documentation. 

Testing and refinement: This project passed testing by showing perfect output as expected so no refinement is required.
